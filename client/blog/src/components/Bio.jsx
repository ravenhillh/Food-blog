        <h1 style={{ display: "flex" }} className="bio-header">My Story</h1>
        <p className="bio-text">Born and raised in Reading, PA. I have worked in kitchens since 1973, my first job was cooking at a summer camp. My journey as a chef
            has taken me from small town Pennsylvania to Philadelphia, to Seattle and eventually to the islands of Hawaii. I have recently worked
            at such notable Seattle restaurants as Cinque Terra, Cedarbrook Lodge and Harrys Fine Foods. I am a dedicated West Seattleite, living in
            the Delridge neighborhood since 1999. In my free time I love to cook, write, ride bikes, and spend time with my wife and four children.
